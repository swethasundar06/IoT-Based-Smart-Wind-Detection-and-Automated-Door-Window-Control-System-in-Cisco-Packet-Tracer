# IoT-Based-Smart-Wind-Detection-and-Automated-Door-Window-Control-System-in-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

This project demonstrates an **IoT-based smart home automation system** that detects wind intensity and automatically opens or closes doors and windows accordingly using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It integrates sensors, actuators, and embedded programming logic to enhance safety and energy efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x**
- IoT Devices: Wind Sensor, Smart Door, Smart Window, Microcontroller
- Embedded Logic using Cisco Packet Tracer's programming interface (JavaScript)
- Wi-Fi/IoT Network Setup

## 📌 Project Overview

The system includes:
- **Wind Sensor**: Continuously monitors wind speed.
- **Smart Door & Window**: Automatically closes if wind speed exceeds a defined threshold.
- **Microcontroller**: Controls decision-making based on sensor input.
- **IoT Communication**: Uses wireless connectivity to transmit sensor data and control actuators.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The **wind sensor** detects wind speed.
2. The **microcontroller** processes the sensor value.
3. If wind speed is **above the safe threshold**, the system:
   - Automatically **closes** the door and window.
4. If wind speed is **within normal range**, the system:
   - Keeps the door and window **open**.
5. The simulation can be modified to show alerts via buzzer, light, or web interface.

## 📂 Files Included

- `IoT-Based Smart Wind Detection and Automated Door-Window Control System.pkt` – Cisco Packet Tracer project file.

## ✅ Features

- Automated wind-responsive control
- Real-time IoT simulation
- Scalable to more rooms/devices
- Ideal for smart home safety applications

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x or above.
2. Run the simulation and adjust wind sensor values.
3. Observe the behavior of doors and windows.
4. Modify threshold values or devices as needed.
